                    I'm an American billionaire business magnate, computer scientist and internet entrepreneur best known for co-founding Google with Sergey Brin.
                    I was chief executive officer of Google from 1997 until August 2001 when I stepped down in favor of Eric Schmidt and then again from April 2011 until July 2015 when I became CEO of its newly formed parent organisation Alphabet Inc. which was created to deliver "major advancements" as Google's parent company, ]
                    a post I held until December 4, 2019 when I along with my co-founder Brin stepped down from all executive positions and day-to-day roles within the company. 
                    I remains an Alphabet board member, employee, and controlling shareholder. As of June 2023, I have an estimated net worth of $112 billion according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, making me the eighth-richest person in the world.
                    I have also invested in flying car startups Kitty Hawk and Opener.
                    I'm the co-creator and namesake of PageRank, a search ranking algorithm for Google. 
                    I received the Marconi Prize in 2004 with co-writer Brin.

                    PageRank (PR) is an algorithm used by Google Search to rank web pages in their search engine results. 
                    The PageRank algorithm outputs a probability distribution used to represent the likelihood that a person randomly clicking on links will arrive at any particular page.
